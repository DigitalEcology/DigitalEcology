- 👋 Hi, I’m Digital Ecologist!

- 👀 I’m interested in free energy and green Internet

- 🌱 I’m currently working on a reserch project. 
Its purpose is to discuss in detail the physical infrastructure of Web 2.0, 
summarize the mistakes we made in the process of creating it and draw conclusions from them. 
This knowledge will help you form your own opinion about the massively advancing digitization: you will be able to take a critical look at its unstoppable growth and development. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on solutions that aims to rise awareness about the digital carbon footprint. 

- 📫 You can reach me under hello@digitalecology.xyz
